  The sentence: 
Mary will drink the glass_of_wine during one minute 
can be considered semantically incorrect. 
Note that sentences like Mary will snore in one minute can receive the interpretation: after one minute.
  Predication
1. she will (snore during the show)!
2. she will (snore)! during the show
In 1., the snoring lasts the whole show. 
In 2., a snoring event occurs at some moment during the show. 
In 1., ‘snore’ is a g that must match with the show considered as a g as well. 
In 2., ‘snore’ looses its temporality and becomes an f that can only be matched to a virtual ‘temporal slice’ of the show.
  FaultyExample2
The problem comes from the fact that ‘snore’ is declared with a typical duration of 1 (= 10 sec.). This duration cannot be matched with the duration of a show. If you change the duration to 3 (= 1000 sec.), the durative interpretation is given by the program. A more general fixing would be to consider, not only typical durations, but intervals or, alternatively, typical values + standard deviations.
